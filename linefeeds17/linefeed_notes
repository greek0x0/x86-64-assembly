linefeeds are essential to console programs

like the hello world program


they become even more important once programs are built with user input 



but linefeeds can be a pain to maintain



sometimes you will want to include them in your strings



and sometimes you will want to remove them 


if we continue to hard code them in variables by adding 0Ah after 

our declared message text,

it will become a problem


if theres a place in the code that we dont want to print out 
the linfeed afterwards


that way we can just call this subroutine 

when we need a linefeed 


and call our current sprint subroutine when we dont 




A call to sys_write requires we pass a pointer 

to an address in memory of the string we want to print

so we cant just pass a linefeed character (0Ah) to our print function 


we also dont want to create another variable just to hold a linefeed character


so we will instead use the stack 



The way it works is by moving a linefeed character into RAX




we then push rax onto the stack and get the address pointed to by the extended stack pointer. ESP is another register 



when you push items onto the stack ESP is decremened to point to the address in memory pf the last item


ESP directly points to the previous item on the stack essentially


since ESP points to an address in memory of a character sys_write will be able to use it to print
